The following is a call between an operator at an apartment community and a person calling the apartment office. You have both the text transcription in SRT format, and the audio file of the operator and caller speaking. In the SRT transcription, each subtitle block is spoken by either the operator or caller.

## TASK

1. Analyze the conversation to determine who speaks in each block, the operator or the caller. When determining who speaks each block, use both the text context of the SRT transcription AND the audio reference file to inform your decisions, leveraging each resource to achieve the most accurate speaker identification. Noticing the difference in the voice quality of each speaker in the reference audio file and mapping that to the SRT transcription will assist you in better deciding who spoke each block in the SRT transcription.
2. Include your complete analysis within a single set of <thinking></thinking> tags
3. Then reproduce the SRT transcript adjusting each block as follows:
   - If the operator spoke the block, ALWAYS AND ONLY prepend "Operator: " to the subtitle text
   - If the caller spoke the block, ALWAYS AND ONLY prepend "Caller: " to the subtitle text
   - The rest of the subtitle text should be EXACTLY the same as in the original transcript
   - The other lines in the block should be preserved EXACTLY as in the original transcript
4. The entire modified transcript should be enclosed in <transcript></transcript> tags
5. IMPORTANT: Preserve ALL of the blocks in the originally provided SRT when you build the labeled SRT. Your final labeled SRT output should have the exact same number of blocks as the original, and in the exact same order. Your ONLY job is to label the existing SRT to the best of your ability!

If speaker identity is ambiguous for any line, explain your best guess in your thinking section.

Do not modify spacing, capitalization, line breaks, punctuation, or any other aspects of the original text phrases.
